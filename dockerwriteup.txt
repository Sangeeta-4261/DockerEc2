Project Name: Dockerizing Angular Application
Tools used: 
*Docker
*aws:ec2 instance
*visual studio code

Requirements:
As a MEAN Stack Developer, you have to deploy an Angular application on Docker container on an EC2 instance

steps we have done:

first we build the angular application by using the command ng build --prod.
after building it generates the dist file, we need to copy that files for furture use.
we need to create a docker file in our angular application.
we build images using the command docker built -p 80:80 image_name.
we need to create the container also.
after that we created the ec2 instance and we have copied the dist files tothe virtual machine.
using the ipv4 address we are able to access the our angular application
